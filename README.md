# Customer-Churn-Prediction
The **Customer Churn Prediction** project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn for one of our client at Fingertips. This model was developed back in 2021. By analyzing customer data, the model identifies customers who are likely to leave, enabling the company to implement proactive retention strategies.
